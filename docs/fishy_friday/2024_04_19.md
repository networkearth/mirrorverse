## Changeset

As predicted this was a short week from a research perspective. Not only was there a bunch of schoolwork but I also, somewhat randomly, ended up flying out to Carlsbad for some Viasat business. As such, not a whole lot to report on this week.

### A Little Bit of Project Management

What I did do was start filling out the [`mirrorverse` wiki](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki) with program management/direction details. My hope is that we can use the wiki to keep everyone up to date on the larger project level view while I continue to use this medium to report on progress week by week. 

Perhaps of most interest right now are these two pages:

- [Home](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki)
- [Development Process](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/The-Development-Process)

### Starting on Finding the Right CWT Data

I also went ahead and did a review of some of the literature on juvenile range estimation in the hopes of finding some studies I could use as a starting point for the idea I presented last week. 

Stand out amongst those was this [paper](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1577/T08-181.1) as it seems like a reasonably clear example of a standardized design (as opposed to just opportunistic CWT sampling).  

However as I've been digging further into the specifics in all of these studies it's becoming clearer and clearer that even though there are loads of retrievals they are distributed over such an extent of space and time that they end up being pretty darn sparse. So this may require a little bit of rethinking on my part. 

Currently on the docket is to go read one of the technical reports from the Pacific Salmon Commission to see how they're using this data today and then to also think through how I could do some fitting without having to create a specific density estimate. 

## Up Next
