## This Week

This will just be a brief this week as too much has happened for me to collect it all here now. In the coming weeks I'm going to keep a "journal" as I go along that I can refer back to at the end of the week. 

- Added aliases to the jobs in the simulation to make things actually debuggable
- Updated the inputs to the sim to allow for full scale (all of GOA and EBS) simulation
- Made changes to all the full month to run in a reasonable amount of time
- Made changes to allow spark to not fall over in greater than month sims
- Found that time, fork length, and genetic region all seem like reasonable candidates for helping solve the "different speeds" issue I've noted before
- Rebaselined the model 
- Trained new models with the new features
- Created specific training, validation, and testing sets so things remain stable over different feature builds
- Upped the sampling when building contrasts to help with generalization
- Validated that contrast likelihood directionality matches full decision likelihood directionality (and therefore constrasts can be used)
- Realized I was reporting on the wrong mean of probability (arithmetic instead of geometric) and fixed that
- Did a bunch of hyperparameter tuning to get more out of the models
- Found that the food features or time features are both great but seem to start creating overfitting problems when put together
- Added dropout layers which helped with overfitting tremendously

Overall I think I trained somewhere close to 2,000 models... thank goodness I'm using AWS. 

## Up Next

- Clearly I need to dig back into my deep learning toolbox and see all the tricks I can pull out to make the models better and my life easier. So I'm just going to step through each part of the model and sort out what's best given I clearly have a set of interesting (and somewhat challenging) features. 
- Will do a better job of documenting as I'm going so there are more numbers next time :)
