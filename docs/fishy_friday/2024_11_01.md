## Changeset

- Built out a [mock simulation](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/models/movement_model/v3/s1/Simulation.ipynb) just to see what we're up against.
- Definitely going to need spark to deal with this at scale. Thought about using Glue but while it's great
for creating objects that can be thrown together in their visual tool it's not fantastic for really intricate
custom code with lots of moving parts and the AWS specific nature of it makes me nervous about using it for 
this application. So I decided to look at EMR serverless (another AWS offering).
- Setup watercycle to be able to deploy [EMR Serverless applications](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/models/movement_model/v3/s1/Simulation.ipynb) and [virtual environments](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/models/movement_model/v3/s1/Simulation.ipynb). 
- Also setup watercycle to be able to [submit custom spark jobs](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/models/movement_model/v3/s1/Simulation.ipynb)
- Then went ahead and updated `haven` to have [spark integration capabilities](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/models/movement_model/v3/s1/Simulation.ipynb). 
- Discovered (very very painfully) in this process that `athena` access just doesn't work without a NAT 
gateway on the EMR VPC and given NAT gateways are very expensive I'll just be doing straight [reads from S3 
buckets and `athena` partition registration locally](https://github.com/networkearth/haven/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#to-be-or-nat-to-be). 

All in all though we're ready to rumble so next week I'll take my mock simulation and write it out at scale!
