## Changeset

- Wrote up a [summary of stability and control](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/429fe2f8c2637b5f23f836e3b75095ee44cb37bf/book/Perspectives%20on%20Stewardship.pdf) for deterministic systems.
- Read some select sections from "Stability of Dynamical Systems" by Michel, et. al. and "Systems and Models" by Bossel.
- Spent a great deal of time attempting to define properties of discreet time subsystems that lead to stability in an overall system to no real avail.

## Next Steps

- Going to be diving into "Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems" by Franklin, et. al. in order to better understand systems control design (as opposed to just definition) as well as how to describe systems in the presence of noise.
