## Changeset

- Made some [updates](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/pull/60) to the proposal. 
- Decided to use PySpark to distribute ETLs and simulation. Added commentary to the [report](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/858818a7c853693a66300462bc37885ca8e3ebc8/report/Report.pdf) (section 2.1) on this, built out the [pipelines](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/pull/61) to train and simulate using PySpark and Keras, and provided an example [notebook](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/d1d8f1dbf164e4e0d796a3c41293d0709141b693/docs/studies/SparkKerasLogOddsModel.ipynb).

## Up Next

- Trip to the UK to train Viasat folks!
- The missing piece right now is easy and well documented hyperparameter tuning so that'll be what I'm tackling next.
- Will continue updating the proposal given what comes out of review.
