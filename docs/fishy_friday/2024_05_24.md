## Changeset

- After adding some diagnostics around odds model convergence I realized that I was overfitting in a way I didn't even realize was possible. Found a way to get around this issue - [Avoiding Noise During Convergence](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/Odds-Modeling#avoiding-noise-during-convergence).
- I was also finding that I was clearly getting model improvements but they were not showing up in the explained variance scores I was looking at. Realized I needed to move over to a statistic computed from a likelihood - [Why Typical Measures Don't Work](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/Odds-Modeling#why-typical-measures-dont-work---likelihood)
- I went ahead and did the update to the training of the depth model in order to account for these things and now have a meaningful pipeline - [Odds Model for Depth Notebook](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/main/docs/studies/Odds_Model_Depth.ipynb)
- I also played around with a few basic features such as daytime/nighttime, month, latitude, sunrise, length of day, and so on. A lot of these features are either highly correlated with one another (and therefore the model learns their effects without the need of all the features) or are a bit too noisy given the amount of data I'm playing around with right now. Lots more exploration to do here but for this week the main point was to get a stage where changing things led to understandable and reliable results and diagnostics and that is now the case!

## Up Next

- I think I've derisked all of this enough to be confident in setting down project goals, steps, etc. so I'm going to switch over to the thesis proposal.
