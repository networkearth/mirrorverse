- Odds modeling depends on iterative updates to our odds target. Started the week by creating a [more rigorous set of updates](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/8565295dd3917ceea4fe3d932c08bb40db43fc88/report/Report.pdf) given we're now targeting the likelihood instead of explained variance.
- Took my depth model notebook and turned it into a [DVC pipeline](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/8565295dd3917ceea4fe3d932c08bb40db43fc88/pipelines/models/chinook_depth/dvc.yaml)
- Updating the odds model had the added benefit of no longer needing to iterate through different datasets so I can use more of the data for training now
- Later in the week while trying out new features I found that as the number of features increase the model would start getting stuck (central likelihood would plateau) long before I figured it should. Turned out this was because I was having to limit the update size to our odds target based on the requirement that odds must remain greater than zero. Fixed this by switching to a [Log Odds model](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/6467cadc4e2682530a3359a9f560412e9dfaadc6/report/Report.pdf) instead.
- Right now I'm finding the best features are day/night, month, home region, progress through day/night, and day/night interval length. Elevation has a lot of feature importance when you add it, but at present doesn't actually seem to improve the central likelihood all that much (probably "correlated" with loads of other things).
- Yesterday I was finding that switching to log odds has now resulted in overfitting just never happening, even when I allow the model very loose hyperparameters. After some debugging it seems that I'm suffering from vanishing gradients. So that'll be the next thing to solve.
