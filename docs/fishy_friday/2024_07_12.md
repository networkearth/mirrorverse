## Changeset 

- Added hyper parameter tuning to the [training notebook](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/d9b4dca3713e819fdd6c84b07ae21cba3a4bdc6a/docs/studies/SparkKerasLogOddsModel.ipynb) as well as full inference across a broad range of timestamps and spatial positions.
- Pulled together some [basic visualizations](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/d9b4dca3713e819fdd6c84b07ae21cba3a4bdc6a/docs/studies/DepthResults.ipynb) of the predictions.
- Reorganized the [report](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/blob/d9b4dca3713e819fdd6c84b07ae21cba3a4bdc6a/report/Report.pdf) to checkpoint the fact that we now have a working model. 
- Had a minor existential crisis about environmental stewardship. ;)

## Next Steps

The past few months have had me introspecting a lot about management, stewardship, sustainability, conservation... the lot. Had a couple existential crises along the way and have realized that it's been a while since I have oriented myself. So I'm going to take a step back for a little while (given summer's a good time for these things) and do just that. 

I've got a clear idea of what I believe my north star should be but I just want to take some time to do some reading and write up an argument (as much to myself as anyone else) as to why it should be what I think it will be. 

TL;DR: I'm gonna take a few weeks to do some research and write up an essay on what environmental stewardship means to me. :)
