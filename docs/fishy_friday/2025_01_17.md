## The Big ToDo List

### Manuscript

- [v1] Clarify the purpose of the tool and the ML loop (aspect of introduction) [it's a specific subset of IBM]
- [v1] Fill out the intro with other attempts at doing things this way (and just IBM's in general)
- [v1] Be clearer in framing why we're taking the steps we are in this illustrative example
- [v1] Be much clearer about how the models are evaluated
- [v1] Table, names, and better descriptions of the models
- [v1] Clarify early on which model is going to be the "null" model
- [v1] Tie in the alternate approaches better to the overall narrative 
- [v1] Add in more commentary on the framing and how this covers a lot of different approaches
- [v1] Be clear about the other applications and the fact that chinook is just an illustrative example
- [v1] Fill out the introduction with more background to show how this is different
- [v1] Be far more detailed in the way the figures are produced and how to look at them
- [ ] Provide some figures of the environmental features
- [ ] Provide some figures on the prediction process
- [ ] Provide some figures on the model architecture



Come back to this tomorrow when your brain doesn't believe everything right now :P 
- [v1] Run through the narrative and tear it to pieces
    - [v1] Add to the conclusion more about how this can be used in all sorts of ways
    - [v1] Add in better notes on the efficiency of all of this
- Are they really log likelihood increases??? 


At this point I've got the point down, and all of the pieces of narrative there. Now it's just about polishing it so that it's sharp as can be. I've got a knife but it's a little dull :) 

### Modeling

- [ ] Additional features
    - [ ] Distance from Shoreline
    - [ ] Seasonality
    - [ ] Temperatures
    - [ ] "Steepness"
    - [ ] Bathymetry
    - [ ] Oxygen saturation
    - [ ] Size of Fish
    - [ ] Genetic Origin
    - [ ] Some Notion of Momentum
- [ ] Are there differences between origin groups? 
    - [ ] Completely separate models per group
    - [ ] Lon/lat encoding of group

## Are There Differences Between Origin Groups

I want to start this question with a simple level of movement model (i.e. just distance) and I want to do this in three ways:

1. Lon/lat encoding of the group (`3.4.8`)
2. Completely separate models per group 

And then look at how this effects the per group performance. Theoretically it shouldn't matter so I'm wondering if any differences do indeed show up. 

For the first we can use `3.4` contrasts and just build a new model. For the others I'll need to break out into the four genetic origins.
