## Changeset

Starting to move more and more of this into the wiki so this fishy friday will be mostly a series of links.

- Started the week attempting to use CWT data to tune a higher level diffuser based model (DBM). Got all the way to the first series of iterations and then realized this - [Effort is Required](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/The-Theory#effort-is-required-when-dealing-with-cwt)
- Given I was suddenly operating at a month by month level the PSAT data got way too sparse to be useful in training and so I realized there's a need for breaking this up into a [hierarchy of models](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/The-Theory#hierarchy-is-key).
- With that in mind I asked - how do we want to take advantage of the PSAT data and realized it could be potentially really really useful for [habitat modeling](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/wiki/The-Theory#preference-modeling)

## Up Next

- I'm currently working on seeing if I can turn the PSAT data into a series of strata along the coast. If I can I'll find some trawl data and see if I can compare abundance estimates using the standard strata in the GOA against these PSAT derived strata.
- Beyond that I'm going to dig back into some of the papers that do combine effort and CWT data to do estimation in order to see if I can pull from the same sources - Andy, I seem to have lost the paper you mentioned around this at our last meeting. Mind forwarding that to me again? Sorry!
