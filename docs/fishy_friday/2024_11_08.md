## Changeset

- Spent a considerable amount of time trying to get `keras` to work on the EMR instances but finally got that working! (Had to upgrade the version of EMR being used and build the virtual environments from a different base image)
- Converted the feature building process to also run in spark so that the code is shared between the sim and the feature building (always a good idea to reduce the number of bugs that'll likely pop up).
- Cleaned everything up and tested that everything is in good working order.

[EMR Serverless Simulation and Feature Build](https://github.com/networkearth/mirrorverse/pull/88)

All in all we have a sim in spark that uses the exact same code as that used to build the features for the 
model in the first place!

## Up Next

At this point I have all the tools I've wanted for building models, running simulations, and the like so now 
it's just learn what the models have to say, improve the models, and repeat!
