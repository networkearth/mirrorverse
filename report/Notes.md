## Notes on the Purpose of Management

> Stewardship is building upon the foundation nature has laid down. What I need to do is convince myself that messing with that foundation is not bound to failure by looking at and understanding the cases where failure has not occurred.

Biomimicry's first chapter is replete with many examples of ecosystem management going well. The following are some thoughts
from that reading. 

It appears to me that the way out of the chaos nightmare so argued in ecology/management is to look to feedback systems. 
While the whole system may in fact exhibit many different forms of non-linearity if each subcomponent is so constructed
as to be resilient to perturbations, then it would seem to follow that the whole system would itself be resilient. As such
the purpose of management would be to find modified states within the ecosystem that bring value to society while also 
ensuring that those states have the kinds of feedback mechanisms built in to make them resilient to all of the different
kinds of perturbations that may arise. However, at this point this idea is nothing more than a vague concept. I would like
to know how to quantify these things to apply them to actual ecological situations. To that end I would like an introduction
to the field that studies these kinds of feedback systems mathematically - **cybernetics**. 

In addition it has also occurred to me that we can greatly simplify our lives by still taking a kind of deconstructive
approach to designing human-in-the-loop ecosystems. Specifically we can start with the kinds of value we'd like to derive
and then work backward to understand what's necessary for that value, understand the roles and jobs that need to be played,
and then look to find organisms who can play those roles. This can keep branching out until we believe we have a complete
system in hand. From there it would come back to the cybernetics to understand how to make sure the whole system remains
resilient. This all makes for a much more bounded and parallelizable problem to solve.
